#+TITLE: DNNL MWE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A minimum working example of an issue I was having with the [[https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn][Intel DNNL]].
#+END_QUOTE

** Building
I build DNNL from source, and placed it in the directory ~\~/tools/mkl-dnn~.  It is installed globally with =sudo make install=

The example can run with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
make
./src/main
#+END_SRC
